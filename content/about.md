Hello. I’m a machine learning compiler engineer at Qualcomm, where I work on improving the performance of AI systems on Qualcomm’s Hexagon DSP architecture by contributing to Apache TVM and its LLVM backend. This site is meant to grow into my personal blog where I intend share anything that sparks my curiosity, from compilers and systems to mathematics and beyond. Nothing is off-limits and I’m always eager to learn new things and share them with you.

I have a master’s degree in Computer Science from Indian Institute of Technology, Hyderabad, where I honed my skills in compiler optimizations.

I hope you find my blog fun and informative. Please feel free to leave your comments and feedback (especially when I'm wrong about something).
