## Who am I

Machine Learning Compiler Engineer @ ARM, Cambridge. I used to work on the [Apache TVM](https://tvm.apache.org/) and [MLIR](https://mlir.llvm.org/) support for hexagon NPU at Qualcomm.

I did my masterâ€™s degree in Computer Science from Indian Institute of Technology, Hyderabad, where I focused primarily on compiler optimizations and High Performance Computing. Even though I spent a lot of time in learning and understanding compilers (specifically LLVM) during my masters, I feel that the most important thing I learned there was being comfortable in learning new things and being completely clueless and lost in the process. That feels like the most important skill now in 2025 as AI models are changing the landscape of software development.

Before my master's I used to work on full stack development including working a lot on frontend with javascript and backend with ruby on rails. I've also worked on early iphone/ipad app development in Objective-C, and android development in Java (before kotlin was introduced).

### Random Personal thoughts

I remember reading Peter Norvig's [Teach Yourself Programming in Ten Years](http://www.norvig.com/21-days.html) when I was doing my bachelor's and was struggling to learn my first programming language. Looking back now, and realizing that I've worked on more than half-dozen languages including (C++, C, python, java, ruby, javascript, golang, Objective-C), it feels incredibly satisfying. Although I would have loved to see a functional language in that list.

This page is expected to turn into my personal blog, which I hope you would find fun and informative (when I actually add the first post). I enjoy learning new things, and I believe we live in a golden age of free and open education, so I plan to blog about anything new I learn.

I also enjoy playing on my xbox quite a bit, especially large open world games like *Red Dead Redemption 2*, *Witcher 3*, *Assassin's creed* series, etc. so, if you're someone who enjoys similar games, or would like to just connect with me for anything, feel free to contact me at [anirudh.sundar@gmail.com](mailto:anirudh.sundar@gmail.com). My socials are in the [home page](/)
