Hello. I'm a ML Compiler Engineer at Qualcomm working on [Apache TVM](https://tvm.apache.org/) for Hexagon DSP. TVM is an open source end to end machine learning compiler framework. I also work on the Hexagon backend for [LLVM](https://llvm.org/), which is the core compiler for Hexagon DSP, and is also the backend target for the TVM compiler.

I have a masterâ€™s degree in Computer Science from Indian Institute of Technology, Hyderabad, where I focused primarily on compiler optimizations and High Performance Computing.

This page is expected to turn into my personal blog, which I hope you would find fun and informative (when I actually add the first post). I enjoy learning new things, and I believe we live in a golden age on free and open education, so I plan to blog about anything new I learn.
