## Who am I

Hello, my name is Anirudh and I'm a Machine Learning Compiler Engineer at Qualcomm working on [Apache TVM](https://tvm.apache.org/). I also work on [LLVM](https://llvm.org/), mostly on the Hexagon backend in LLVM. I love working on any programming problem, but specifically enjoy optimizing programs to run faster on different architectures, especially if we could get the compiler to do that for us.

I did my masterâ€™s degree in Computer Science from Indian Institute of Technology, Hyderabad, where I focused primarily on compiler optimizations and High Performance Computing. Even though I spent a lot of time in learning and understanding compilers (specifically LLVM) during my masters, I feel that the most important thing I learned there was being ready to learn new things. That is most important today in 2023 as GPT-4 and other AI models are becoming powerful enough to make it feel like they could replace all our jobs.

Before my master's I used to work on full stack development including working a lot on frontend with javascript and backend with ruby on rails. I've also worked on early iphone/ipad app development in Objective-C, and android development in Java (before kotlin was introduced).

### Random Personal thoughts

I remember reading Peter Norvig's [Teach Yourself Programming in Ten Years](http://www.norvig.com/21-days.html) when I was doing my bachelor's and was struggling to learn my first programming language. Looking back now, and realizing that I've worked on more than half-dozen languages easily including (C/C++, Java, python, ruby, javascript, golang, Objective-C), it does feel incredibly satisfying. Although I would have loved to see a functional language in that list (javascript comes close in some ways, but I never really used it that way).

This page is expected to turn into my personal blog, which I hope you would find fun and informative (when I actually add the first post). I enjoy learning new things, and I believe we live in a golden age of free and open education, so I plan to blog about anything new I learn.

I also enjoy playing on my xbox quite a bit, especially large open world games like *Red Dead Redemption 2*, *Witcher 3*, *Assassin's creed* series, etc.

So, if you're someone who enjoys similar games, or would like to just connect with me for anything, feel free to contact me at [anirudh.sundar@gmail.com](mailto:anirudh.sundar@gmail.com). My socials are in the [home page](/)
